This repository contains a MATLAB function with a subtle bug related to unhandled boundary conditions in an if-elseif-else statement.  The `myFunction` attempts to handle different ranges of input values, but fails to explicitly define the output for values precisely equal to the thresholds (10 and 5). This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors depending on how MATLAB handles these cases. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function.
